A Varanasi Boatman’s Tea-Break Dilemma

Boatman Suresh ferries pilgrims along the Ganges to Manikarnika Ghat, located 5 km downstream from his home dock (point 0). He can choose any drop‐off point \theta (even upstream, \theta<0), row there, then walk the rest of the way to the ghat at +5 km.

His total effort costs are:
	1.	Rowing effort: \tfrac12\,(5 - \theta)^2 (it’s harder to row the farther he goes).
	2.	Cart‐drag penalty: \theta^2 (his load of puja-items tires him proportional to distance squared).
	3.	Chai stops: b \times |\theta| (he must sip b cups of chai—each cup costs effort—per km rowed).

So overall:
\text{Effort}(\theta)
= \tfrac12\,(5 - \theta)^2 \;+\; \theta^2 \;+\; b\,|\theta|.

Let \theta^*(b) be the drop-off km that minimizes Suresh’s effort for a given tea-rate b.

⸻

The Big Question (Indian Version)

At what tea-rate b^ (cups-of-chai per km) does Suresh’s best strategy “tip” from “not rowing at all” (\theta^=0) to “rowing partway toward the ghat” (\theta^*\neq0)?


The Varanasi Boatman’s Wind‐Effect Puzzle

Boatman Suresh ferries pilgrims from his home dock (point 0) downriver to Manikarnika Ghat at point 5. He may choose any drop-off location \theta (measured in km downstream; we assume \theta\ge0), row there, then walk the rest of the way to 5.

His total effort (in abstract “effort-units”) is
C(\theta)
\;=\;
\underbrace{\frac12\,(5 - \theta)^2}{\text{rowing effort}}
\;+\;
\underbrace{\theta^2}{\text{load penalty}}
\;+\;
\underbrace{b\,\theta}_{\text{wind effect}},
where:
	•	b>0 is the extra effort per km when rowing against the wind (headwind),
	•	b<0 is the effort saved per km when rowing with the wind (tailwind).

We write \theta^*(b) for the value of \theta that minimizes C(\theta).

⸻

Question
Critical tipping points:  For what values of b does the best drop-off θ* switch from θ*=0 to some θ*≠0?


Find the unique value b^* such that:
	•	For b \ge b^*, the minimizer is \theta^*(b)=0 (best to stay at the dock).
	•	For b < b^*, the minimizer is \theta^*(b)>0 (best to row partway).

Give b^* as a number.

Detailed Solution (Simple Steps)
	1.	Split upstream/downstream
	•	Downstream (θ>0): |θ| = θ
	•	Upstream   (θ<0): |θ| = –θ
	2.	Compute the downstream critical point
	•	For θ>0:
C(θ) = ½(5−θ)² + θ² + b·θ
C′(θ)=−(5−θ)+2θ+b = 3θ + (b−5)

•	Set C′=0 ⇒ 3θ + (b−5)=0 ⇒ θ₊ = (5−b)/3
	•	This “downstream” candidate is valid whenever θ₊>0 ⇔ 5−b>0 ⇔ b<5.

	3.	Compute the upstream critical point (for reference)
	•	For θ<0:
C(θ) = ½(5−θ)² + θ² − b·θ
C′(θ)=−(5−θ)+2θ−b = 3θ − (b+5)

	•	Set C′=0 ⇒ 3θ = b+5 ⇒ θ₋ = (b+5)/3
	•	This “upstream” candidate would be valid only if θ₋<0 ⇔ b<−5.

	4.	Compare costs at θ₊, θ₋, and θ=0
	•	At θ=0: C(0)=½·25=12.5.
	•	At θ₊ (for any b<5), you can plug in and see C(θ₊)<12.5.
	•	At θ₋ (only for b<−5), you can plug in and find C(θ₋)>C(θ₊).
In every test (e.g. b=−6,−10), the downstream candidate C(θ₊) is far smaller than C(θ₋).
	5.	Conclusion
	•	For b ≥ 5, no positive‐θ critical exists (θ₊≤0), so best is θ*=0.
	•	For b < 5, the downstream critical θ₊>0 always beats both θ=0 and any upstream θ₋.

Therefore there is only one tipping point:

\boxed{b^* = 5.}

As soon as the head‐wind penalty drops below 5 effort‐units per km, Suresh’s best plan switches from “stay at the dock” to “row partway downstream.”

Consider the cost function
C(θ) = ½·(5 – θ)²   +   θ²   +   b·|θ|,

where b is a real parameter. For what critical value of b does the location of the minimizer \theta^ switch from \theta^=0 to a nonzero value?  Give that critical b as a number.

Detailed Solution

We want to find the value of b at which the minimizer of

C(\theta) \;=\; \frac12\,(5-\theta)^2 \;+\;\theta^2\;+\;b\,\bigl|\theta\bigr|

moves off \theta=0.

⸻

1. Write the derivative piecewise

Because of the \bigl|\theta\bigr| term, split into two regions:

⸻

Case A: \theta>0

Here \lvert\theta\rvert=\theta, so
C(\theta)
= \tfrac12\,(5-\theta)^2 \;+\;\theta^2 \;+\; b\,\theta.
Differentiate w.r.t.\ \theta:
C’(\theta)
= -(5-\theta)\cdot1 \;+\;2\theta \;+\; b
= -5 + \theta + 2\theta + b
= 3\theta + (b - 5).
Set C’(\theta)=0 to find the interior critical point:
3\theta + (b - 5)=0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\theta^* \;=\;\frac{5 - b}{3}.
This is valid (i.e.\ \theta^*>0) exactly when
\frac{5 - b}{3} > 0
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
5 - b > 0
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
b < 5.

⸻

Case B: \theta<0

Here \lvert\theta\rvert=-\theta, so
C(\theta)
= \tfrac12\,(5-\theta)^2 \;+\;\theta^2 \;-\; b\,\theta.
Differentiate:
C’(\theta)
= -(5-\theta)\cdot1 \;+\;2\theta \;-\; b
= -5 + \theta + 2\theta - b
= 3\theta - (b + 5).
Set to zero:
3\theta - (b + 5)=0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\theta^* = \frac{b + 5}{3}.
This lies in \theta<0 exactly when
\frac{b + 5}{3} < 0
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
b + 5 < 0
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
b < -5.

⸻

2. Determining the transition
	•	If b<5 then the positive‐\theta case yields
\displaystyle \theta^*=\frac{5 - b}{3}>0.
	•	If b>-5 then the negative‐\theta case yields no negative solution.
	•	If -5 \le b \le 5, neither interior critical point lies in the correct half‐line, so the only candidate is \theta=0.

Thus the minimizer jumps off zero precisely when
b<5.
The critical value at which it switches is
\boxed{b=5.}

⸻

3. Check the second derivative

In each region C’’(\theta)=3>0, so each interior solution is indeed a local minimum. At b=5, the positive critical point \theta^*=(5-5)/3=0 collides with the origin—hence the switch.

⸻

Possible Variants
	1.	General coefficients
C(\theta) = \tfrac12\,(d-\theta)^2 + a\,\theta^2 + b\,|\theta|,
where d,a,b are constants.  Ask for the region in the (a,b)‐plane where \theta^*\neq0.
	2.	Asymmetric linear cost
Use two penalties b_+\theta for \theta>0 and b_-(-\theta) for \theta<0.  Find when the minimizer is positive, negative, or zero.
	3.	Higher‐order penalty
Add a cubic term c\,|\theta|^3.  Find conditions on b,c for a nonzero minimum.
	4.	Multiple treasure points
Suppose there are two treasures at positions d_1 and d_2, and travel cost is
\tfrac12[(d_1-\theta)^2+(d_2-\theta)^2].  Include quadratic and linear setup penalties and find the minimizer.
	5.	Exponential travel discount
Replace \tfrac12\,(5-\theta)^2 with \tfrac12\,(5-\theta)^2e^{-k\theta}.  Explore how the critical b depends on k.
	6.	Multi‐dimensional start
Let \theta\in\mathbb{R}^n and cost involve \|\mathbf d - \theta\|^2 + a\|\theta\|^2 + b\|\theta\|.  Find when \theta^*\neq\mathbf0.
