1A. Treasure Hunt
A hidden treasure lies at point 5 on a straight path. You choose any real starting point theta. Your total energy cost is:

5. Smart Lamp Chain-Rule

We have
	1.	s=2x+1 ⇒ ds/dx=2.
	2.	b=\dfrac{s}{1+s} ⇒ db/ds=\dfrac{1}{(1+s)^2}.
	3.	v=100\,b^2 ⇒ dv/db=200\,b.

By the chain rule,
\frac{dv}{dx}
= \frac{dv}{db}\;\frac{db}{ds}\;\frac{ds}{dx}
= \bigl(200\,b\bigr)\;\frac{1}{(1+s)^2}\;(2).
At x=0:
	•	s=2\cdot0+1=1,
	•	b=\tfrac{1}{1+1}=0.5.
Thus
\frac{dv}{dx}\Big|_{x=0}
= 200\,(0.5)\;\frac{1}{(1+1)^2}\;2
=100\;\frac{1}{4}\;2
=50.
Answer: The lamp’s chirp volume increases at 50 units of volume per radian at x=0.
